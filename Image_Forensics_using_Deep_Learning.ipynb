        "## Introduction:\n",
        "\n",
        "In an era of ever-evolving digital media and widespread use of image-editing tools, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of images has become an imperative concern. With the rise of digital image forgery, the need for robust and efficient image forgery detection methods has become more pronounced. This mini-project aims to address this challenge by developing a deep learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image forgery detection.\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary objective of this project is to create a model capable of detecting forged images accurately and swiftly, with an ideal inference time of up to 1 second per image. To achieve this goal, we will leverage the power of deep learning, utilizing either the PyTorch or TensorFlow framework, both renowned for their flexibility and optimization capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Dataset and Data Preparation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "For this project, we will use the MICC_F600 dataset, a comprehensive collection of images containing various types of forgery, including copy-move forgeries. To ensure the model's robustness and generalization, I first sorted the data set into folders with the different classes of images then applied data augmentation techniques such as random rotations, flips, and shifts. These augmentations will help the model learn invariant features, thereby enhancing its detection accuracy when presented with real-world images.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Model Building:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Our chosen approach for image forgery detection involves constructing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). A CNN is ideally suited for image-based tasks due to its ability to automatically learn hierarchical features from raw pixel data. The architecture of the CNN will be designed thoughtfully, taking into consideration factors such as model depth, convolutional and pooling layers, activation functions, and regularization techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Training and Evaluation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The MICC_F600 dataset will be split into training and testing subsets to train and evaluate the model, respectively. During the training phase, the CNN will be trained using the training data, and its performance will be monitored using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Hyperparameter tuning will be performed iteratively to strike a balance between model complexity and generalization ability.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Deliverables:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The deliverables for this mini-project will include a well-documented Jupyter/Colab Notebook that walks through each step of the process. Clear explanations will be provided for data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation. Visualizations and plots showcasing various performance metrics will be presented to provide insights into the model's effectiveness.\n"

        "\n",
        "* **Volatility:** The graph is highly oscillatory. This suggests that the learning rate is too high. A smoother descent might be obtained by reducing the learning rate or using learning rate scheduling techniques. This is something we can consider in tuning efforts.\n",

        "\n",

        "* **Model Architecture:** Depending on the current architecture of your model, consider making it deeper or shallower. Try different activation functions or batch normalization.\n",

        "* **Different Optimizer:** While Adam is a popular and effective choice, you might want to experiment with other optimizers like SGD with momentum, RMSprop, or Adagrad.\n",
        "* **Monitor Validation Loss:** Instead of just tracking training loss, also track validation loss to understand if the model is overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Check Data Quality:** Ensure that the data labels are accurate and that there's no data leakage. Check if the distribution of original_images and tampered_images is balanced. If not, consider techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or using weighted loss.\n",
        "\n",

An accuracy of **82.5%** suggests that the model is correct for a significant portion of instances, but there's room for improvement. The high precision of **92.1%** indicates that when the model predicts an instance as positive, it's often correct. However, the recall of **85.4%** indicates that there's a notable percentage of actual positive instances(about 14.6%) that the model is missing. The F1-score of **88.6%** considers both precision and recall and can be used as a single measure to gauge the model's overall performance.\n",
