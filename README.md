# Image Forgery Detection Project

## Introduction

In the digital age, the authenticity of images plays a crucial role across various industries, from journalism to identity verification. However, the rise of advanced image manipulation tools has made it challenging to verify the genuineness of these images. This repository focuses on detecting tampered images using machine learning and image processing techniques. The project consists of the following four notebooks:

1. **Document Forgery Detection With SIFT (Mini-Project)**
   - Focuses on passive image forensics using the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm and homography estimation.
   - [Read More](./Document_Forgery_Detection_Mini_Project.ipynb)
   
2. **Image Forensics with Deep Learning**
   - Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image forgery detection.
   - [Read More](./Image_Forensics_using_Deep_Learning.ipynb)

3. **Image Forensics with TensorFlow 1**
   - Extends the deep learning approach using TensorFlow.
   - [Read More](./Image_Forensics_using_Deep_Learning_3.ipynb)

4. **Image Forensics with TensorFlow 2 (No Mask)**
   - Another TensorFlow-based approach, specifically designed to eliminate data leakage.
